						<h2>What is it?</h2>
						<p>Usage of third-party libraries, commercial and open-source, has increased in applications over time.</p>
						<p>Even the most utilised and trusted components can contain vulnerabilities that compromise their security.</p>
						<p>Introducing these libraries improperly can lead to the introduction of the security flaws to all applications which use them.</p>
						<p>Projects including multiple dependancies can potentially be introducing large numbers of security vulnerabilities!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Impact</h2>
						<p>The range of potential components mean that the impact of introduced vulnerabilities can vary depending on the application using them.</p>
						<p>It was estimated that 26% of all downloads from the 'central' repository contained a vulnerability.</p>
						<p>More information on it's prevalence can be found <a href="http://www.aspectsecurity.com/research-presentations/the-unfortunate-reality-of-insecure-libraries" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Exploiters</h2>
						<p>There are plenty of reasons to target 3rd party libraries for security flaws rather than directly targeting the main application.</p>
						<p>Components are often open source and therefore the potential exploiter has access to the code to determine the vulnerabilities.</p>
						<p>The potential for any flaw to extend across multiple applications also makes it an appealing target, as the discovery and exploitation of any  vulnerability grants a large range of potential targets.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Updates and fixes</h2>
						<p>Usually after security vulnerabilities are discovered it does not take long for developers to update and fix the issue.</p>
						<p>However a lot of the time there is no clear mechanic for informing users of any updates for security purposes.</p>
						<p>This means it is quite common for applications to be using out of date dependancies with old security vulnerabilities still in place!</p>
						<p>This is a worse scenario as the older issues tend to be better known and therefore more people know how to exploit them.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Undiscovered vulnerabilities</h2>
						<p>In many cases the vulnerabilities found in component libraries are not yet discovered.</p>
						<p>As a result many new breaches are not due to new updates to the library but already existed in the code.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section id="flaw-solution">
						<h2>Solution!</h2>
						<p>There are very few ways to prevent utilisation of vulnerable third party software short of never using any third party dependancies at all.</p>
						<p>There are however methods to at least reduce the risk in using libraries.</p>
						<p>Following the four simple steps outlined below allows at least an extra degree of control and security.</p>
						<p>Additionally GDS guidelines on third party libraries can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/dependency-management.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Inventory</h2>
						<p>The first step is to take stock of your current project dependancies and versions.</p>
						<p>This involves looking up known faults and vulnerabilities for the version used as well as how out of date it is.</p>
						<p>This also involves checking the dependancies of the dependancies which are often overlooked.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Analyze</h2>
						<p>When acquiring or updating a library make sure to always check for yourself the status of the build.</p>
						<p>If examining code directly is infeasible then check reviews, process, licenses and other aspects of the library project.</p>
						<p>This early step can help prevent a lot of hassle compared to dealing with problems further down the line.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Control</h2>
						<p>A good process to have in place is a method by which only authorised libraries and versions can be used in projects.</p>
						<p>A developer can request to have a library added to the list when a suitable level of analysis is complete.</p>
						<p>The method to determine what ends up on this list should not be overly difficult as it will encourage users to bypass the restriction.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Monitor</h2>
						<p>Where analysis has shown it to be safe, all dependancies should be kept up to date.</p>
						<p>Having to alter your code to take into account of an update is no excuse not to do so and is an accepted fact of using third party libraries.</p>
						<p>As there are typically no automated methods to be informed of updates to libraries, it is the developer's job to keep up to date with the library's development status and news.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="flaw-tools">
						<h2>Tools</h2>
						<p>There are some automated tools that can keep you informed of the latest news and versions of dependancies.</p>
						<p>While these are useful and can be a time-saver, they are no substitute for performing the checks yourself.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Tools</h2>
						<p>SBT can be used to keep dependancies up to date by using 'latest-integration' in place of the version number but this may not be wanted behaviour.</p>
						<p>OWASP's Dependency Check is a tool that examines dependancies for any publically reported vulnerabilities for java libraries.</p>
						<p>Sonatype's CLM is an automatic tool designed to manage dependancies throughout the development lifecycle.</p>
						<p>"Bobby" is an in house tool created to perform a similar function as Dependancy Check for scala libraries.</p>
					</section>

				<section>
					<section  id="flaw-examples">
						<h2>Examples</h2>
						<p>What will follow are two famous examples of third party libraries introducing vulnerabilities.</p>
						<p>There are typically no reports on more recent cases until the problem has been fixed to avoid more people attempting to exploit it.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Spring MVC (2013)</h2>
						<p>The vulnerability existed due to the behaviour of the Expression Language utilised by Spring.</p>
						<p>Using an HTML request the intruder could directly inject code and execute it server side, potentially even taking control of the server.</p>
						<p>This was a previously fixed issue that re-emerged due to the discovery of additional issues relating to the flaw.</p>
						<p>At the time an estimated 1.3 million instances of the flawed component had been downloaded at the time.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Apache CXF (2012)</h2>
						<p>The vulnerability occurred whenever a user submitted a request without providing any identity token.</p>
						<p>This allowed any web service to be executed with full permission without authentication.</p>
						<p>This was also the second emergence of the issue with a prior occurance of a similar fault in 2010.</p>
						<p>An estimated 4.2 million downloads of the framework occurred within a 12 month period in 2013.</p>
